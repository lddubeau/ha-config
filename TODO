* We have logic that attempts to keep on the lights that are on at the time we
  go into "away" mode. Unfortunately, the occupancy simulation code completely
  ignores the lights that we spared in lights_off_when_away.yaml.

  Ideas:
    - When going away, scan all lights, record a list of those that were off.
      Make a group/store in a variable these lights.

    - The occupancy code must then affect lights only in that group/variable.

  The problem with that idea is that it is very ad hoc. If the light needs to be
  locked for other reasons, it will need another infrastructure to lock it.
